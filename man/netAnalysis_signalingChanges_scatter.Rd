\arguments{
\item{object}{A merged CellChat object of a list of CellChat objects}

\item{idents.use}{the cell group names of interest. Should be one of `levels(object@idents$joint)`}

\item{color.use}{a vector with three elements: the first is for coloring shared pathways, the second is for specific pathways in the first dataset, and the third is for specific pathways in the second dataset}

\item{comparison}{an index vector giving the two datasets for comparison}

\item{signaling}{a char vector containing signaling pathway names. signaling = NULL: Signaling role analysis on the aggregated cell-cell communication network from all signaling pathways}

\item{signaling.label}{a char vector giving the signaling names to show when labeling each point}

\item{top.label}{the fraction of signaling pathways to label}

\item{signaling.exclude}{signaling pathways to exclude when plotting}

\item{slot.name}{the slot name of object}

\item{dot.size}{the size of the symbol}

\item{point.shape}{point shape}

\item{label.size}{font size of the text}

\item{dot.alpha}{transparency}

\item{x.measure}{The measure used as x-axis. This measure should be one of `names(slot(object, slot.name)$centr[[1]])` computed from `netAnalysis_computeCentrality`

Default = "outdeg" is the weighted outgoing links (i.e., Outgoing interaction strength). If setting as "outdeg_unweighted", it represents the total number of outgoing signaling.}

\item{y.measure}{The measure used as y-axis. This measure should be one of `names(slot(object, slot.name)$centr[[1]])` computed from `netAnalysis_computeCentrality`

Default = "indeg" is the weighted incoming links (i.e., Incoming interaction strength). If setting as "indeg_unweighted", it represents the total number of incoming signaling.}

\item{xlabel}{label of x-axis}

\item{ylabel}{label of y-axis}

\item{title}{main title of the plot}

\item{font.size}{font size of the text}

\item{font.size.title}{font size of the title}

\item{do.label}{label the each point}

\item{show.legend}{whether show the legend}

\item{show.axes}{whether show the axes}
